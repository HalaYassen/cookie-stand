      <h3>About Cookies</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar and
        some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.
        <br>
        In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called biscuits. Many
        Canadians also use this term. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom.Some
        cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.
        <br>
        Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and
        Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are
        often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes "dunked", an approach which releases more
        flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars, while also softening their texture. Factory-made cookies
        are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries
        and coffeehouses, with the latter ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations
        such as Starbucks.
